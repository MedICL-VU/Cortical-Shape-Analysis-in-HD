# Comprehensive shape analysis of the cortex in Huntingtonâ€™s disease

Comprehensive cortical shape analysis in Huntington's disease. 

Submitted for publication in *Human Brain Mapping*. 

## Requirements: 
- [SurfStat](https://mica-mni.github.io/surfstat/)
- Stats and ML toolbox (MATLAB)
- Signal Processing toolbox (MATLAB)

## Usage
1. Run the R pipeline (stat.R) to completion for each feature to obtain the chi-squared values. 
2. Run the MATLAB pipeline (omni_stat.m) for each feature to correct and visualize the detected areas on the cortical surface.
